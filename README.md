### Project Setup (Windows)
 Download the latest version from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), open the downloaded file, and follow the steps from the installer.

 To use discord.js, you'll need to install it via npm (Node's package manager). npm comes with every Node installation, so you don't have to worry about installing that. 

Clone or download the project folder and open this in your IDE of choice. Open a terminal window at the root of this folder and run:

Install node package manager: `npm init -y`

Install discord.js node package: `npm install discord.js`

Install ESLint for VS code: `npm install --save-dev eslint` (You will also need to install the plugin inside VSCode - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
